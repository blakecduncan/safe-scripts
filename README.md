# Safe scripts

This is just a repo to hold some scripts for my personal testing of creating safe accounts.

Most of this code is taken from [safe-contracts repo](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts) and [account abstraction repo](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction)

I also created a [fork](https://github.com/blakecduncan/safe-contracts) of the safe-contracts repo where and pulled in the account-abstraction contracts for testing 4337 safe account. That is not for production use as I made changes to the the contracts.
